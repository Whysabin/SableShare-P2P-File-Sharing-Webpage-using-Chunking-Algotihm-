Here's the usage guide in point form:
SableShare Usage Guide
 **SableShare Usage Guide**

1. **Download and Setup:**
   - Download and extract the **SableShare** project files (because who doesn’t love a good zip file, right?).
   - Open the extracted folder in **Visual Studio Code** (the editor that makes you feel like a coding wizard).
   - Install any necessary dependencies and extensions (don’t worry, they’re like your project’s vitamins—essential but not hard to swallow).
   - Hit **Go Live** in Visual Studio Code to launch the server, and the page will open in your browser. Welcome to the future of file sharing!

2. **Test on Multiple Devices/Platforms:**
   - Open the same page on **different browsers** or **devices** (because apparently one browser isn’t enough for your tech-savvy self).
   - Designate one as the **sender** and the other as the **receiver** (just like a relay race, but with files instead of a baton).

3. **Connecting the Devices:**
   - On the **receiver's device**, copy the **unique ID** displayed (kind of like copying your friend's phone number—but less creepy).
   - On the **sender's device**, click **Connect**, paste the **receiver's ID**, and just like that, you're connected. It's like magic, but with JavaScript!

4. **Sending and Receiving Files:**
   - On the **sender's device**, choose a file to send (it could be a cat meme, a spreadsheet, or your high score in Tetris—your choice).
   - On the **receiver's device**, hit **Accept** when prompted (no, it’s not a dating app, but it does require consent).
   - Once the transfer is done, the **receiver** will get a confirmation message saying “File Received.” Cue the confetti!

5. **Viewing Data Transfer in Developer Mode:**
   - Press **Shift + I** to open **Developer Tools** in your browser (because you’re a tech wizard, and you want to see the magic happen).
   - Go to the **Console** tab to watch the data packets being sent in tiny **chunks**. You’re basically watching data move at the speed of light (or at least at the speed of your internet connection).

     
I admit, I used ChatGPT to create this guide(you already know by seeing the sign *). But don't worry—this joke was also generated by ChatGPT! 😄
"Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts bugs!" 🐛💡

Now go share some files, and remember: SableShare isn’t just a file transfer tool, it’s your new best friend... who doesn’t mind waiting for your files to upload.
